## zbc-pytorch-benchmarker
This repo contains the code to benchmark and compare pytorch calcuation  runs.  This was created with OpenAI, and is a working example of what OpenAI can do.


## Requirements

To run this script, you will need to have the following packages installed:

- PyTorch: You can install PyTorch by following the instructions on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/). Make sure to install the correct version for your system (e.g., CPU-only, CUDA-enabled).

- tqdm: You can install tqdm by running `pip install tqdm` in your terminal.

Note: You may also need to have a CUDA-compatible GPU and the relevant drivers installed in order to run the script. If you do not have a CUDA GPU, you can still run the script by commenting out the lines that move the model and input data to the GPU.


## What does this code do?

The script begins by importing the necessary modules, including the torch module for defining and training neural networks, and the torch.nn module, which provides classes for defining and building neural network architectures. The script then defines a PyTorch model named "SimpleConvNet" that extends the nn.Module class and overrides its __init__ and forward methods.

The __init__ method, which is called when the model is instantiated, initializes the model by defining two convolutional layers and their associated ReLU activation functions. These layers are defined using the nn.Conv2d and nn.ReLU classes from the torch.nn module, respectively. The __init__ method then prints the values of the conv1 and conv2 attributes, which represent the first and second convolutional layers, respectively.

The forward method defines the forward pass of the model, which specifies how the input data is processed by the model to produce the desired output. In this case, the forward pass consists of sequentially applying the convolutional layers and ReLU activation functions to the input data, and then returning the resulting output.

After defining the model, the script instantiates it, moves it to the GPU (if available), and saves it to a file named "model.pt". The script then loads the saved model from the file and moves it to the GPU again. Next, the script generates some input data and moves it to the GPU. This input data is used to run the model multiple times in a loop, and the average elapsed time is calculated and printed. This process is useful for benchmarking the performance of the model on the given input data.
