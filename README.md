## zbc-pytorch-benchmarker
This repo contains the code to benchmark and compare pytorch calcuation  runs.  This was created with OpenAI, and is a working example of what OpenAI can do.

## What does this code do?

1.	Import the torch module, which provides functions for building and training neural networks in PyTorch.
2.	Import the torch.nn module, which provides classes for defining and training neural networks.
3.	Import the time module, which provides functions for measuring time.
4.	Define a SimpleConvNet class that extends the nn.Module class from PyTorch. This class will define a simple convolutional neural network.
5.	Define the __init__ method, which is called when an object of this class is instantiated. This method initializes the parent nn.Module class and defines two     convolutional layers and two ReLU activation functions.
6.	Print the values of the conv1 and conv2 attributes of the object to the console.
7.	Define the forward method, which defines the forward pass of the neural network. This method takes an input tensor and applies the two convolutional layers and ReLU activation functions in sequence, returning the resulting tensor.
8.	Print a message to the console indicating that the model is being instantiated.
9.	Instantiate an object of the SimpleConvNet class and assign it to the model variable.
10.	Move the model to the GPU, which will accelerate its calculations.
11.	Print a message to the console indicating that the model is being saved to a file.
12.	Use the torch.save function to save the model to a file called "model.pt".
13.	Print a message to the console indicating that a PyTorch model is being loaded from a file.
14.	Use the torch.load function to load the model from the "model.pt" file.
15.	Move the loaded model to the GPU.
16.	Print a message to the console indicating that input data is being generated for the model.
17.	Generate some random input data for the model and assign it to the input_data variable.
18.	Move the input_data to the GPU.
19.	Print a message to the console indicating that the benchmark is starting.
20.	Define a variable called num_runs that specifies how many times the model should be run to compute the average elapsed time.
21.	Initialize a variable called total_time to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the total elapsed time of the benchmark.
22.	Use a for loop to run the model on the input_data multiple times.
23.	Inside the for loop, start a timer to measure the elapsed time of the model's forward pass.
24.	Use the model to process the input_data and store the result in the output variable.
25.	Stop the timer and calculate the elapsed time.
26.	Update the total_time variable with the elapsed time.
27.	After the for loop, print the average elapsed time by dividing the total_time by the number of iterations.
